# PHYS-499-MODELING-A-THREE-FILAMENT-PLASMA-EXPERIMENT-WITH-AN-ADAPTED-SINGLE-FILAMENT-MODEL
All material generated during the completion of the PHYS 499 undergraduate research course. Simulations were heavily modified from the origional source code of [1]. "modeturbo.mat" is from the origional source code of [1] so please cite [1] if you use that file for your own research. You will need that script to run any of the simulations found in this respostory. To recive the origonal source code, contact the corrisponding author of [1].
